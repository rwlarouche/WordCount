I ran down the street chasing a fox. I ran so fast that I ran past the fox. Now the fox is chasing me. I tripped on an apple and scraped my knee. The fox ate the apple and gave me a band aid for me kee. The band aid worked quick and healed my knee. The fox and I ran down the street together. We are fast.
