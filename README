WordCount implementation using MapReduce.

Project Description:

Project uses a single WordCount.java program (jar compiled into three .classes):
1. The mapper maps the contents input files (all .txt files in the input folder) into key,value pairs corresponding to word, frequency.
2. The reducer takes the mapped key, value pairs and reduces them to a single list of key, value pairs and then returned in an output file mapping the word, frequency pairs as single entries/sum for across all input files.
